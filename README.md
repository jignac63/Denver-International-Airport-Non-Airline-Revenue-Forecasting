# Denver International Airport – Non-Airline Revenue Forecasting

Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts non-airline revenue sources at Denver International Airport using statistical and machine learning time series models. The results support budgeting, capacity planning, and strategic decision-making.

1. Tools and Technologies
	•	Programming: Python, R
	•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Linear Regression, Random Forest
